# College-Football-Tableau-Story-Visualization
A group project for Information visualization at Iowa. The goal was to use data that we found interesting to build and show a story with different graphs based on our college football data that we found
The graphs are focused on highlighting conference success over the timespan of the data and the graphs explain the story being told and why that is occurring
